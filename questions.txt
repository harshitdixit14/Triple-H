    description=
    given 1D array nums and integer k we have to find count of partitions such that
    sum of each partition in >= k.
    so going other way around and finding the count in which at least one partition has sum<k
    then subtracting the count with total count to have desired answer.
    Reasoning behind why " finding negation of a problem "
    => becoz first I tried the simple method which was requiring me to create a DP table which was
    giving MLE as sum was exceeding memory limit.
    This time with finding negation we only have to consider k sum only.
